# Recycl.ly
Recycl.ly is a project created for the needs of the second edition of the Mini Hackathon programming competition.  I co-created the project with two friends. Recycl.ly responds to the needs of ordinary people and the global environment by helping to recycle and inspiring people to share ideas for reusing items.
