# Recycl.ly

The project created for the needs of the second edition of the Mini Hackathon programming competition. I co-created the project with two friends.

Recycl.ly responds to the needs of ordinary people and the global environment by promoting recycling and inspiring people to share ideas for reusing an item. Our solution addresses the problem of society's indifference to the condition of the environment. Thanks to our application, recycling will become a more accessible and common idea. The planned premium element of our application will meet the needs of the lack of time for recycling, which torments the majority of society.
